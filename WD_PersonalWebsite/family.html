  <p class="body_text">I presently have a family of 5. There's me, My 2 younger sisters, and my parents. My mom works the day</p>
  <p class="body_text"> shift as a registered nurse, while my dad works the night shift at his job, so usually their schedules </p>
  <p class="body_text">contradict each other and I only see one of them at a time. As a result of this, there's a good percentage </p>
  <p class="body_text">of the time where I act as the babysitter for my two younger sisters whenever something's come up and </p>
  <p class="body_text">my parents need to step away from my sisters.</p>

  <p class="body_text">Presently, My sisters Evelyn and Cecelia are in kindergarten and 1st grade. They both attend Park Lane </p>
  <p class="body_text">Elementary, and for the most part they get along fine (key words:&quot;for the <em>most</em> part&quot;). Evelyn is the middle </p>
  <p class="body_text">sister, with her being 7 years old, while Cecelia is the youngest, being 6 years old. Personality wise, </p>
  <p class="body_text">Evelyn is more of the &quot;popular kid&quot; type, with her actually being one of the more popular kids at her </p>
  <p class="body_text">school, while Cece is more like me in which she tends to keep more to herself, but she doesn't hesitate to </p>
  <p class="body_text">put herself out there depending on the circumstance. An interesting fun fact, but Cece is actually ahead of </p>
  <p class="body_text">her class in multiple skills by at least 1-2 grade levels (pretty impressive!).</p>
