<h1>Adopting Fozzie</h1>
<p class="body_text">We adopted Fozzie just a few days after he was old enough to be adopted. He was small enough to where you could </p>
<p class="body_text">fit him into one hand. When we first brought him home, he was shy at first, which is to be expected. After about a day</p>
<p class="body_text"> or two staying in my room, however, he began to warm up to me, and then everyone else slowly. He became very </p>
<p class="body_text">snuggly, even doing that rolling thing that Holly does whenever she's happy. The picture to the left shows him doing </p>
<p class="body_text">this while on top of his cat climber. It wasn't just limited to his climber either; anything he could find, he would snuggle</p>
<p class="body_text">with. This included: My gaming chair - especially whenever I was sitting in it (seen below, to the right), a stuffed tiger </p>

  <p class="caption">Fozzie laying in my lap as I sit in my<br>
    gaming chair</p>
  </figure>
<p class="body_text">plush that I keep on my floor, my couch, and even inside my dresser. After it was okay to</p>
<p class="body_text"> finally let him out and explore the rest of the house, the fun still never stopped for him. </p>
<p class="body_text">By this, I mean he was a flat out goof ball in many more ways than one. One major </p>
<p class="body_text">example of this (once again, seen below to the left), is him deciding that he would fight </p>
<p class="body_text">off anyone who tried to steal the laundry, which in itself is too cute to pass up a picture.</p>
<p class="body_text">From there on, it's been a lot of fun whenever Fozzie is around, which can be taken in</p>
<p class="body_text">one of two ways. For one, watching him act like a total goofball is oddly entertaining </p>

<p class="caption" style="text-align: left">Fozzie "guarding" our laundry by <br>

</p>
</figure>
<p class="body_text">enough to watch in itself; but on the other hand, when you have to literally pull him away </p>
<p class="body_text">from other cats so they don't end up fighting to the death constantly, it can get a little </p>
<p class="body_text">old.</p>
