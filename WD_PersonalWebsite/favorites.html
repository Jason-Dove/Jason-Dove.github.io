	<h3>Persona 3: The Movie</h3>
	<p class="body_text">While it's technically a series of 4 movies, they're all based off of the same game: <em>Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3</em>. </p>
	<p class="body_text">The story follows Makoto Yuki, a high school student who lost his parents in an accident 10 years ago, who learns </p>
	<p class="body_text">there is a period of time hidden between one day and the next. This period is known as the Dark Hour, a time when</p>
	<p class="body_text"> monsters called Shadows appear. He soon learns how to fight against Shadows that threaten the world from the </p>
	<p class="body_text">tower of Tartarus, the place where the Shadows normally reside.</p>
	<p class="body_text">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="body_text">There are so many things I love about this movie, most of which I won't go too in depth about, but I can give a brief </p>
	<p class="body_text">explanation for. The first thing being the animation. You can actually see the characters in high quality, whereas</p>
	<p class="body_text"> you couldn't in the game as it was slightly older. Another aspect I like is the depiction of characters in situations that</p>
	<p class="body_text"> would make sense for them, to flesh them out in a unique way that we didn't see in the game. the only real &quot;dislike&quot;</p>
	<p class="body_text"> I have about the movies is that the story had to be cut in many ways that lost some of the original feel that we felt in</p>
	<p class="body_text"> the game.</p>
