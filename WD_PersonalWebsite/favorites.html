	<h3>Persona 3: The Movie</h3>
	<p class="body_text">While it's technically a series of 4 movies, they're all based off of the same game: <em>Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3</em>. The story follows Makoto Yuki, a high school student who lost his parents in an accident 10 years ago, who learns there is a period of time hidden between one day and the next. This period is known as the Dark Hour, a time when monsters called Shadows appear. He soon learns how to fight against Shadows that threaten the world from the tower of Tartarus, the place where the Shadows normally reside.</p>
	<p class="body_text">There are so many things I love about this movie, most of which I won't go too in depth about, but I can give a brief explanation for. The first thing being the animation. You can actually see the characters in high quality, whereas you couldn't in the game as it was slightly older. Another aspect I like is the depiction of characters in situations that would make sense for them, to flesh them out in a unique way that we didn't see in the game. the only real &quot;dislike&quot; I have about the movies is that the story had to be cut in many ways that lots some of the original feel that we felt in the game.</p>
