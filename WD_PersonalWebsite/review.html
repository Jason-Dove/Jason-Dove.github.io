<h2>Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</h2>
<p class="body_text"><em>Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</em> is the sequel to <em>Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc.</em> The game's overall plot, mechanics, etc are relatively the same with a new spin on things. The story follows Hajime Hinata, a student who the player is first introduced to as we see him walking towards Hope's Peak Academy, an extremely prestigious high school that if you succeed in gaining acceptance, then you are essentially set for life. Because of this, however, it will only accept the most &quot;elite&quot;, or &quot;ultimate&quot; (or &quot;Super High School Level&quot;in the original translation of<em> DR: THH</em>) students; the prodigies that definitely know what they are doing when it comes to their talents. As Hajime enters the academy, he finds himself stuck with the &quot;Ultimates&quot; in the killing game, a &quot;game&quot; in which all 16 students are forced to kill each other indiscriminently. this is where the game itself is split into three major parts per chapter: Daily life, where you get to 	do literally whatever you want, Deadly life, where a killing has happened, and things become more serious, and the Class trial, where the player is tasked with finding the &quot;blackened&quot; that committed the crime.</p>

<p class="body_text">Each chapter of the game starts out with Daily Life, which allows the player to explore the environment, play side mini-</p>
<p class="body_text">games, or progress other characters' free time events, which are opportunities for the player  to learn more about said </p>
<p class="body_text">characters and strengthen their bond with them. The player is given multiple options to increase their bond with a character, </p>
<p class="body_text">for example, by talking to them and giving them presents, which, in turn, will add pages to each student's Report Card, and </p>
<p class="body_text">grant the player special skills which can give them an advantage during Class Trials.</p>

<p class="body_text">you are able to gain their testimony for where they were and things they possibly saw, which will also grant the player a truth bullet. This overall could be useful </p>

<h1>Class Trial</h1>
<p class="body_text">Class Trials are the final act of each chapter of the main <em>Danganronpa</em> games. The students debate amongst themselves, using evidence collected   during the </p>
<p class="body_text">investigation phase, to determine the culprit in each   chapter. The debate takes place in a courtroom setting, and consists of   several debate phases and </p>
<p class="body_text">minigames. The trial ends when the culprit -   known as the "Blackened" - is uncovered, and ultimately executed, or if   the culprit isn't identified, the jury is executed,</p>
<p class="body_text"> ultimately ending   the killing game and allowing the culprit to graduate. </p>
