<h3>Article by Joshua Zemmin</h3>
<p class="text">American history starts with colonists believing that there was a better way to rule because the governing rule they were living in was unjust. Thanks to the philosophy of someone 100 years before the birth of our country, Natural Law would be the foundation of our very own U.S. Constitution. </p>
<p class="text" dir="ltr">During a time of British colonization in the early 1600s people that lived in America lived and breathed British rule and the belief that it was just and fair. Why wouldn&rsquo;t they? &nbsp;They were British citizens too and they were patriotic people.  More than one hundred years later, the British colonists that lived in the Americas started to realize that British rule wasn&rsquo;t just and fair. &nbsp;They realized that the laws and rules were being made without considering the colonists themselves.  American colonists, as I will call them, knew it was time to separate from Britain and develop their own government. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text" dir="ltr">It would be the belief and philosophy of John Locke who wrote that every human being had the natural right to life, liberty, and owning property. John Locke believed that people were servants of God and that as servants, we were entitled to these freedoms. These Natural Laws were rights for everyone no matter who they are or which class they were born into. Unlike the British Monarchy where you had more rights because of your birth, John Locke wrote about all of God&rsquo;s children should have those same rights.</p>
<p class="text" dir="ltr">Our founding fathers believed in John Locke&rsquo;s philosophy and based our Constitution on those beliefs. &nbsp;It took a lot of blood and death of both Americans and British, but in the end, Natural Law would be the foundation of our American laws. These Natural Laws will continue to show its face throughout our American history time and time again. &nbsp;These rights based on Natural Law was made to protect individual people and their pursuit of happiness. </p>
<p class="text" dir="ltr">Yet some people believe that our founding fathers did not completely agree with Natural Laws &nbsp;as a foundation of our government.  We know that our United States Bill of Rights came after our United States Constitution. &nbsp;Our Bill of Rights is where you can obvious see that Natural Laws for our government needed to be stated.  For example, our First Amendment states that we have the freedom of religion, speech, assembly, and petition. These Natural Laws are not exactly stated in the Declaration of Independence, but had to be added in our United States Bill of Rights. &nbsp;It is as though the United States Constitution needed to include more Natural Laws.  Also, our United States Bill of Rights were created to protect the people of Natural Laws from our government taking them away. </p>
<p class="text" dir="ltr">The United States Constitutional Principles, the themes based on our United States Constitution is based on Natural Laws. Individual Rights is the right of the people to request the government to change a problem and make laws to fix those problems. Republicanism is the right of the people to elect a representative to create the just laws under the rules. &nbsp;My favorite is Popular Sovereignty which is the rule of the people.  That the government is there because the people allow it to happen.  These are based on Natural Laws. </p>
<p class="text" dir="ltr">Our founding fathers made a new government based on Natural Laws. &nbsp;They started with the philosophy of John Locke, and continued that belief in our laws and rules in our country today. &nbsp;With these Natural Laws we have a better life where we all have the right to the pursuit of happiness. </p>
