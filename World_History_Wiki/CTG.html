She was invited to Russia when she was fifteen years old by Czarina Elizabeth, a daughter of Peter the Great. &ldquo;Catherine and her new husband had a rocky marriage from the start. Though the young Prussian princess had been imported to produce an heir, eight years passed without a child.&rdquo; (8 Things you didn&rsquo;t know about Catherine the Great). Many believe Peter was infertile and couldn't have kids, both being unhappy with their marriage they each had affairs.

<p class="text">Catherine's rule was set apart by huge regional extension, which extraordinarily added to Russia's coffers however did little to ease the enduring of her kin. Indeed, even her endeavors at administrative changes were frequently stalled by Russia's tremendous organization. In any case, Catherine viewed herself as a standout amongst Europe's most edified rulers, and numerous students of history concur. She composed various books, handouts and instructive materials went for enhancing Russia's training framework. She was likewise a victor of expressions of the human experience, keeping up a deep rooted correspondence with Voltaire and other noticeable personalities of the period, making one of the world's most amazing craftsmanship accumulations in St. Petersburg's Winter Palace and notwithstanding attempting her hand at composing opera. Catherine began as a political and social reformer anyway a little bit at a time grew logically moderate as she got increasingly settled. In 1767 she gathered the Legislative Commission to systematize Russia's laws and in the process modernized Russian life. She gave the commission her Nakaz, (or 'Direction'), a strikingly liberal record that presented the ruler's vision of the ideal government. The commission made no perfect results and the scene of war against the Ottoman Empire in 1768 gave a better than average opportunity to disband it. &ldquo;The Pugachev Rebellion of 1774-1775 gained huge support in Russia's western territories until it was extinguished by the Russian army. Catherine realised her heavy reliance on the nobility to control the country and instigated a series of reforms giving them greater control over their land and serfs.&rdquo; (BBC Catherine the Great). Catherine, nevertheless, would not have advanced toward getting to be ruler if her significant other had been at all normal. He was incredibly masochist, disobedient, difficult, possibly powerless, practically alcoholic, and, most truly, a fanatical admirer of Frederick II of Prussia, the foe of the sovereign Elizabeth. Catherine, then again, was reasonable and objective arranged. Her insight, versatility of character, and love of Russia got her much help. In November 1796, Catherine died of a stroke at the age of sixty-seven, she was the oldest of any Romanov monarch. She is buried in the Cathedral of the Peter and Paul Fortress.</p>
