<p class="text" id="docs-internal-guid-b0fdafcf-7fff-3817-ac7c-c1ef8f93a344" dir="ltr">Voltaire was born on November 21st, 1694. He was a French writer and public activist who played a role in defining the Enlightenment, he was one of the leading writers. He was born to middle-class parents, attended college in Paris, where he began to study law. Voltaire later quit law to become a playwright and made a name for himself with classical tragedies. His work had a new conception of philosophy and influenced the modern concept, yet in other ways Voltaire was not a philosopher at all in the modern version of the term. He wrote many plays, stories, and poems, and he directed many of his critical writings against the philosophical claims of philosophers such as Leibniz, Malebranche, and Descartes. He was a defender of a conception of natural science that served in his mind as an antidote to show philosophical investigation. His beliefs were very simple and straightforward; he was an overall peaceful person, but was very opinionated and passionate about his own beliefs as opposed to others. He was a vegetarian and a advocate of animal rights. </p>

<p class="text">Voltaire found inspiration in Isaac Newton, John Locke and Francis Bacon, and their ideals of a free and liberal society, along with freedom of religion. Although that voltaire liked freedom of religion, he was very critical towards Christianity, Judaism and Islam, he praised Hinduism, because he thought the Hindus were &quot;peaceful and innocent people, equally incapable of hurting others or of defending themselves.&quot;His most well known poetry includes The Henriade (1723) and The Maid of Orleans, which were only started but were never fully completed. &nbsp;Critics embraced his poem, La Henriade, but its satirical attack on politics and religion infuriated the government. Voltaire's popular works took the form of the short stories: Micromégas (1752) and Plato's Dream (1756), as well as Candide (1759), which is considered his greatest work. Candide is filled with philosophical and religious parody, and in the end the characters refuse optimism. A lot of people believe that he was trying to show and encourage people to be actively involved to improve society. In 1764, he published another of his philosophical works, Dictionnaire philosophique, an encyclopedic dictionary that showed the concepts of enlightenment and rejected the ideas of the Roman Catholic Church. </p>
<p class="text" dir="ltr">In 1716, Voltaire was exiled to Tulle for mocking Philippe I, the duke of Orléans. He later returned to Paris in 1717, only to be arrested and exiled to the Bastille for a year because he was writing insulting poetry.. He was sent to the Bastille again in 1726, for arguing with the Chevalier de Rohan (The Duke&rsquo;s son). This time he was only detained for a short time before being exiled to England, where he stayed for about three years. He returned to France at the end of 1728 or the beginning of 1729, where his social position became stronger. By good judgement, he began to build up the fortune that gave his independence. The failure of some of his plays made him understood what defeat felt like. He had attempted the comédie larmoyante, or &ldquo;sentimental comedy,&rdquo; since it was very popular, but had no success. Voltaire never married and never had any kids, he died from disease on May 30, 1778.</p>
