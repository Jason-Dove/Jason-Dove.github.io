	<h3>Article by: James Reeves</h3>
	<p class="text">On march 9th 1776 In his first book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments Adam Smith had the idea of an invisible hand the tendency of free markets to regulate themselves by means of competition. Supply and demand, and self-interest But he is most famous for his 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. The main idea of Smiths thought was that humans natural tendency toward self interest or in today&rsquo;s terms. looking out for yourself results in success. Smith believed that by giving everyone freedom to produce and exchange goods as they pleased free trade and opening the markets up to domestic and foreign competition, people's natural self interest would promote greater prosperity than with stringent government regulations. Smith believed humans ultimately promote public interest through their everyday economic choices. He or she generally indeed neither intends to promote the public interest nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value he intends only his own gain and he is in this as in many other cases led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention, states Smith in An Inquiry Into The Nature And Causes Of The wealth Of nations 1776.</p>
	<p class="text">Laissez faire economics is defined as a situation with minimal government intervention. Under laissez faire. Governments and regulators leave alone private firms to allow them to make decisions about production and output. In particular laissez faire involves zero minimal government intervention on issues such as regulation taxes and tariffs. Laissez faire is a French term and is said to have originated in the Eighteenth Century. French industrialists were asked about the optimal policy for the French government to help business and the term laissez faire was used in response translating as leave us alone Let do and pass. The phrase is traditionally attributed to the French businessman Legendre. Responding to a Mercantilist minister Colbert.</p>
	<p class="text">Laissez faire stood in contrast to the Mercantilist theory of trade which advocated accumulation of gold and placing tariffs on imports. Laissez faire was also a reaction against the perceived incompetence and bureaucracy of Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century states. Philosophically Laissez faire corresponded to emerging political doctrines about the rights of men and freedom from state interference. It also shared similarities to Darwinism the survival of the fittest is an idea used to justify allowing unprofitable firms to go out of business for the greater good.</p>
  <p class="text">For 300 years before Adam Smith Western Europe was dominated by an economic system known as mercantilism. Though it provided for modest improvements in life and liberty over the feudalism that preceded it, it was a system rooted in error that stifled enterprise and treated individuals as pawns of the state. Mercantilist thinkers believed that the world&rsquo;s wealth was a fixed pie giving rise to endless conflict between nations. After all if you think there&rsquo;s only so much and you want more of it you&rsquo;ve got to take it from someone else. Mercantilists were economic nationalists. Foreign goods they thought were sufficiently harmful to the domestic economy that government policy should be marshaled to promote exports and restrict imports. They wanted their nations exports to be paid for not with foreign goods but in gold and silver. To the mercantilist the precious metals were the very definition of wealth, especially to the extent that they piled up in the monarch&rsquo;s coffers. Adam Smith changed a lot of people's minds and helped change the world, He died in 1790.</p>
