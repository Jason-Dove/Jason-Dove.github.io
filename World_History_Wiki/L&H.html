	<h2 class="gold">John Locke</h2>
	<h3>Article by: Joeseph Kosztowny</h3>
	<p class="text">John Locke was a very well known philosopher of the 17th century. He is very well known for his founded of the school of British Empiricism he made very outstanding contributions to some modern theories of limited, liberal government. Locke showed us empiricist theory which means we get our ideas through our very own experiences in the world. Meaning our minds are able to consider, compare and put these ideas in many different situations. One of Locke&rsquo;s most important works was his essay Concerning Human Understandings, he wanted to explore the human mind and its very fascinating knowledge. We get knowledge through different ideas that we think about in our head. His essay gained a lot of support in great Britain it contained a lot of different philosophical themes.</p>
	<p class="text">This amazing English philosopher and political theorist laid a lot the bases and beginning work for Enlightenment and made many contributions to develop liberalism as well. John Locke had many very important political theories of government such as the government being able to protect life, liberty and estates. Which really impacted the United States of America founding documents (Declaration of Independence). John Locke also had some work on religious tolerance which provided a very early model for the separation of the church and state. Unlike Thomas Hobbes John Locke was completely for natural laws and he believed in natural human rights and a person is born as a blank tablet and everything comes from experience and you learn everything from your experiences with other people and other things.</p>
	<p class="text">He believed that are existed comes from god and that we are free and strong human beings that are able to adapt to are surroundings in order to survive. At birth he greatly believed that people had the opportunity to life, liberty and property. John Locke really like the Englished powered monarchy because it is not absolute power. This was his favorite monarchy and government. He influenced the French Revolution and helped with the Declaration of Independence. John Locke&rsquo;s essay concerning Toleration he explains how one single religion would never work because one cannot be convinced into belief through violence no matter how hard you try. John Locke wrote another book which addresses who should rule the government's. It was called The Two Treatises of Government in this book he explained for one to rule they should have the ability to keep order and not have all that chaos. In his book John Locke basically convinced everyone that god doesn't decide who gets to be a ruler/king. Locke agreed with Hobbes that there was a state of nature he just thought it to be different than what Hobbes believed.</p>

	<h2 class="gold">Thomas Hobbes</h2>
	<h3>Article by: Niko Millazzo</h3>
	<p class="text">Thomas Hobbes (1588 - 1679) was an English philosopher, more in particular a political philosopher. He is best known for his views on the political system and how humans fit into society, his views can come off as humans being self centered, untrusted, and even egotistical. Most of these views were written inside one of the most influential philosophical texts in the 17th century, The Leviathan. This book was mostly created in response to the fear he felt during the broken political state that was the English Civil Wars. Inside The Leviathan, Hobbes proposed something known as &ldquo;The Social Contract Theory&rdquo;, which in short was the idea that humans should sacrifice some of their Natural Rights to a higher authority to maintain order, control, and peace. Some people however, disagreed with this point of view. Enter John Locke.</p>
	<p class="text">John Locke (1632 - 1704) was another political philosopher that also talked deeply about the state of nature. While Hobbes spoke negatively of humans in the regard of nature. Locke took a more positive outlook on the subject. Claiming that humans were born with &ldquo;Natural Law&rdquo; and should not have to obey a &ldquo;Superior Power&rdquo; with one of his most famous quotes being &ldquo;The Natural Liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on Earth&rdquo; whereas Hobbes is known more for the quote &ldquo;Government is necessary, not because man is naturally bad, but because man is by nature more individualistic than social&rdquo; two very countering points.</p>
	<p class="text">For his time, Hobbes was accused several times of atheism, the act of not believing in god. This was a big deal back in the 17th century and Hobbes would always defend himself and has once said &ldquo;Atheism is the greatest defamation possible&rdquo;. However, he has also stated that true revelation can never disagree with human reason and experience, so his religion was confusing due to his beliefs. Bringing a widespread disagreement to his views on religion as a whole.</p>
	<p class="text">Hobbes was not shy of opposition and enemies either. John Bramhall was a bishop who disagreed heavily with Hobbes&rsquo; views so far as he would send private letters to Hobbes explaining his arguments and awaiting a response. The two kept going back to back arguing with each other, in 1656 Hobbes replied with astonishing force to the bishop, with The Questions concerning Liberty, Necessity, and Chance The bishop put his final attack out in 1658 with The Catching of Leviathan the Great Whale.</p>
	<p class="text">In October 1679, Thomas Hobbes passed away due to a bladder disorder and a paralytic stroke. He was one of the most influential philosophers of all time and his works have passed down in history to present. Weather or not you agree or disagree with his points, you can&rsquo;t deny he was one of the most influential people, changing the political system, how humans fall into society, and discussing some of the deepest thoughts mankind has ever had.</p>
