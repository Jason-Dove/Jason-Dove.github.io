<h3>Article by: Elizabeth Cardinal</h3>
<p class="text" id="docs-internal-guid-65665786-7fff-7b89-d597-afe42f91bc69" dir="ltr">Baron de Montesquieu, birthdate January 16th, 1689, and death date February 10th, 1755, was a French political analyst who lived during the Age of Enlightenment. Montesquieu was also a French judge, man of letters, political philosopher and most famously known for his thoughts on the separation of powers. </p>
<p class="text" dir="ltr">Montesquieu&rsquo;s father, Jacques de Secondat, belonged to an old military family of modest wealth, while his mother, Marie-Françoise de pensel, was a pious lady of partial English extraction according to britannica.com. Later on soon after young Montesquieu&rsquo;s parents died, at 27 he was now socially and financially secure. He settled down to exercise his judicial function and to advance his knowledge of the sciences ( geology, biology, and physics) which he studied in the newly formed academy of Bordeaux. </p>
<p class="text" dir="ltr">In 1721 he surprised everyone by publishing &ldquo;Lettres persanes&rdquo; in which he gave a portrait of French and Parisian civilization supposedly seen through the eyes of two Persian travelers. This exceedingly successful work mocks the reign of Louis XIV, which had only recently ended. Worldhistory.biz states &ldquo;the Work&rsquo;s anonymity was soon penetrated, and Montesquieu became famous&rdquo;. </p>
<p class="text" dir="ltr">Montesquieu now wanted to reinforce his literary achievement with social success. He attempted to enter the Académie Française. A vacancy there rose in October 1727. Montesquieu has powerful supporters, with Madame Lambert&rsquo;s salon firmly pressing his claims he was elected and took his seat on January 24th, 1728. Shortly after this Montesquieu strives to complete his education by leaving everything and traveling the world. </p>
<p class="text" dir="ltr">With many close friends in England, Montesquieu was elected a fellow of the &ldquo;Royal Society&rdquo;. He got to attend parliamentary debates and read the political journals of the day. His stay in England was one of the most formative periods of his life. </p>
<p class="text" dir="ltr">His affability and modesty are commented on by all who met him. He was a faithful friend and kind and helpful to young in the society. Through his education and travels he became a sharp social commenter and political thinker who gained respect of fellow philosophers with his work &ldquo;The Spirit of Laws&rdquo;, which went on to have a major influence on English and American government. Montesquieu died of a fever in Paris, February 10th, 1755.</p>
