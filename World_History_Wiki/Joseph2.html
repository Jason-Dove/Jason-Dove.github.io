	<p class="text">Joseph the Second was a future Holy Roman emperor who tried to strengthen the Hapsburg empire his progressive and enlightened reforms and views. He was born March 13th, 1741 in Vienne, Austria, and died February 20th, 1790 in Vienna as well, according to britannica.com. Joseph got his education mainly through Voltaire, and got his training through government officials. According to thefamouspeople.com, Joseph married Maria Josepha Of Bavaria and Princess Isabella Of Parma. He had one daughter, Archduchess Maria Theresa Of Austria. However, since he had no sons, he was succeeded by his brother Leopold the Second. His mother, Maria Theresa, was originally the ruler of the empire. However, when she died, Joseph took over and became the absolute ruler. He began to enforce rules that his mother would’ve never approved of. According to biography.com, Joseph put out more than 690 decrees a year, which is just an official order placed by someone in power, while Theresa had not even made 100 per year. Joseph abolished serfdom, which is a person who is forced into servitude, according to dictionary.com, ended censorship which came with the war on censorship, limited the power of the Catholic church, and granted more religious freedom and tolerance. According to holyromanempireassociation.com, Joseph is ranked as one of the top three Enlightenment monarchs, and his policies now have the name of Josephinism. According to lumenlearning.com, Joseph implemented education reforms that were continuations of his mothers. Elementary school education became a law for all citizens, and higher education was offered for a select few people. He also created scholarships for students who were talented but poor, and allowed schools for the Jewish and minorities. Joseph did have more controversial implements, however, including changing the main language of instruction from Latin to German, which was a big deal in a multilingual empire, and also trying to modernize the Catholic church, which was the least popular of all of his reforms. Joseph also implemented the Patent of Toleration which granted religious freedom to Lutherans, Serbian Orthodox, and Calvinists, which ended in 1781, and the Edict of Tolerance in 1782 which extended the Jewish religious freedom. The Patent basically stated that other religions could practice their religious beliefs in clandestine churches, and the Edict allowed Jewish children to go to school, opened up more job opportunities for them, and even got rid of the requirement to wear gold stars if Jewish. When Joseph passed away, he was heartbroken over the fact that his servants couldn’t and wouldn’t carry out his implemented plans. Although his reforms are remarkable to people now, at the time he was seen as too progressive, and many believed he was destined to fail from the beginning. There were still people who believed he did good, and French historian Jean Berenger says that Joseph’s reign “represented a decisive phase in the process of the modernization of the Austrian Monarchy.” Joseph was a very important person in the Enlightenment because of all of the efforts he made for reform, whether they succeeded or not.
