  <p class="text">Until the end of the 7 years war in 1763, few colonist in the British North America objected to their place in the British empire. After the French and Indian war, Britain took the unusual step of taxing the colonist for the cost of the war. Colonist has been taxed before, but those taxes had been levied by Colonial legislators. They also had been taxed by Britain, but these taxes had been for purposes of regulation, rather than revenue. They needed to tax the colonist to help pay for troops and supplies. Also, Britain needed money to pay for its war debts. The king and parliament believed they had the right to tax the colonies.</p>
  <p class="text">The colonist protested by saying that these taxes violated their rights as British citizens. The colonist started to resist by boycotting, or not buying british goods. In 1773 some colonist in Boston demonstrated there frustration by dressing up like Indians, sneaking onto ships in the harbor, and dumping imported tea in the water. This was called the Boston Tea Party. The Boston Massacre began on March 5th, 1770 that started with a small argument between British private Hugh White and a few colonist outside of the Custom House in Boston. The colonist used this event to there advantage, the British had a response to the Boston Tea Party too, they were aware that this event could have devolved into something more serious.</p>
  <p class="text">The Britishes strategy was they changed throughout the course of the war as they came up against more obstacles and challenges than they anticipated. There strategy at the beginning of the war was to simply contain the American Revolution in Massachusetts and prevent it from spreading. On the other hand the Americans didn&rsquo;t develop a real strategy in the Revolutionary war until George Washington took control of the Continental Army on July 3rd, 1775.</p>
  <p class="text">In April of 1775, a group of colonist fought against the British Army in the battles of Lexington and Concord. In 1775 the second continental congress decided to form a continental army, which consisted of citizens from 13 colonies. George Washington was selected to be the Commander-In-Chief of the army. The colonies were ready to fight for their rights. The Stamp Act of 1765 was one such measure, it created an excise tax on newspapers, custom documents, license, college diplomas and most legal documents. Although the Stamp Act was widely popular in England where taxes were far higher than they were in the colonies, it was uniformly resented in the colonies. Nine colonial legislatures officially expressed their objections to this British tax, and civil disobedience to this Act was rampant throughout the colonies. The Stamp Act became increasingly unenforceable, and in March 1766 Parliament revoked it.</p>
  <p class="text">King George III declared the colonies in rebellion on August 23, 1775. In November, Governor Dunmore signed his Emancipation Proclamation placing Virginia under martial law and granting freedom to all slaves and indentured servants who would bear arms for the king. Excerpts from Thomas Paine's Common Sense, which influenced many a fence-sitter, were published in the Virginia Gazette in February 1776, and the Declaration of Independence followed a few months later.</p>
