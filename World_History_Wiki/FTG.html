<p class="text">Frederick II of Prussia, better known as Frederick the Great, was born in modern day Germany on the twenty fourth of january, 1712, in the city of Berlin. Frederick became the third king of Prussia (1740-1786) and spent his reign during the eighteenth century expanding Prussia's military force as well as Prussias territorial boundaries. While Frederick II was king, he also synthesized Prussia into a modern nation due to his domestic morals that he shared in common with many enlightened philosophers.</p>
<p class="text">Frederick was the son of the calvinist king Frederick Wilhelm I, who was commonly known as &ldquo;the soldier king&rdquo;. Early on in Frederick the Great's youth, Frederick was forced to go through rigorous military training because his father was displeased with his interests in civilized activities like music and languages. When Frederick was at the age of eighteen, hes was court-martialed for attempting to flee to Britain followed up by being forced to bare witness to his best friends execution. Eventually Frederick continued his military studies and also wrote letters to the great philosophe Votare. In 1733 Frederick married Elizabeth of Brunswick for political reasons.</p>
<p class="text">Fredericks declared war against Austria immediately after ascending to the throne on may 31st, 1740. Fredericks first action was to attack the region of Austria known as Silensia. This would mark the start of the war of Austrian Succession that lasted eight years. Due to the Prussians superior military force and tactics, Frederick was able to annex Silensia and later lead an army of 140,000 men into Bohemia which ended with a treaty of negotiations in 1748.</p>
<p class="text">Due to Fredericks success during his first war as king, he was popularly called Frederick the Great. Now that Frederick achieved military glory, he then sought to address Prussias domestic policies and enacted many reforms. He liberalized the press and even supported a moderate amount of religious toleration. Some of Fredericks largest accomplishments for modernizing Prussia was when he banned torture, dug more canals to influence more trade, enacted protective tariffs for his country and ordered the construction for his Rococo palace.</p>
<p class="text">By the time the Diplomatic Revolution hit and Austria had made an alliance with Russia and France, Frederick had made an alliance of his own with Britain as well as mustered 154,000 troops. Eager for another shot at glory, Frederick the Great had used his rebuilt army to attack Saxony, Austria's ally, in 1756. During this time of war Frederick achieved many military victories, but at the expense of his population. This Seven Years War came to an end in 1763 and Frederick picked right back up with domestic reform within Prussia.</p>
<p class="text">Frederick the Great went down in history as the longest ruling king of any hohenzollern king. He has been remembered as Frederick the Great for his great military success against the Austrians and their allies. Frederick not only was a great military ruler but an enlightened one as well, bringing modern domestic policies to his nation and inspiring others to do so as well so that our world could evolve as a whole for a more civilized humanity.</p>
