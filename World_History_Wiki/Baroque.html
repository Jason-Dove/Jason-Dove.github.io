	<p class="text" id="docs-internal-guid-fadc5d4f-7fff-2c52-8aca-b7d9d7ee32fd" dir="ltr">Relating to or denoting a style of European architecture, music and art of the 17th and 18th centuries that followed mannerism and is characterized by ornate detail. In architecture the period is exemplified by the palace of versailles and by the work of Bernini, in Italy. Major composers include Vivaldi, Bach and Handel, Caravaggio and Rubens are important Baroque artists. The word &ldquo;Baroque&rdquo; means broken. More instruments were becoming available and the need for music grew. Singers and instrument players studied for years to be perfect. Rules for writing music were created that are still used today. <br />
  </p>
	<p class="text" dir="ltr">Started around 1600 and ended around 1700. This gave a more refined style of music than the Renaissance period. Started because music was developing into something new and bold. People were either really wealthy or really poor there was not a middle class. Lifestyles did become more elaborate looks more fancy and is more fancy. There was a rise in the drama area, Theater, painting, Architecture and music entertainment. &nbsp;Bach had twenty children and five of them had became musicians. Wigs became very popular among the men during this time. Scented purses were carried by both men and women because back then there was a lack of bathing throughout the community. <br />
</p>
	<p class="text" dir="ltr">This was a time of kings, castles, royal pomp and ceremony, also a time of growing towns and development of trade, manufacturing and education in Europe. Because most Baroque musicians worked as servants of the royal court, the church, or the town, their music reflected their occupation. Court musicians wrote dances and music for concerts and ceremonies. Church musicians wrote instrumental and vocal music for church services. The Rhythm Emphasis was on strong beats, upbeats and fast changing rhythmic motion. Eights, sixteenths and triplets were frequently used. The style is faster notes were normally played legato-connected and smooth. Slower notes normally played monegato-separated. Ornaments were frequently used. Instrumental Baroque music instruments - flute, oboe, basson, trombone, valueless trumpets and horns, harpsichord, organ, timpani. Music written for instruments contained several sections called movements. Concerts have featured one soloist or group of soloists. Usually contained three movements (fast- slow- fast). Music Genres of Baroque music. Concerts are a form of orchestral music that employs a solo instrument accompanied by an orchestra. Concerts Grosso is a form of orchestral music during the Baroque period where in the music is between a small group of solo instruments called concerinto and the whole orchestra called tutti. The word &ldquo;Baroque&rdquo; is derived from the portuguese &ldquo;Barocco&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;oddly shaped pearl&rdquo;. The 19th century who applied this term used it because they thought the music of the era sounded overly and exaggerated and ornamented. That is why it was called the Baroque period. What&rsquo;s so important about the Baroque period and music was the Western Composers stopped writing modal music and used major and minor keys to write tonal music. And suddenly there was an explosion of different musical styles. Outside music in the Baroque period Copernicus informed everyone that the planets didn&rsquo;t revolve around the earth, the telescope was invented, and a new middle class developed, which brought a new perspective to all art forms, which had previously been dependent on the whims of the court and church. Bach was so important during this period because he created tonal (major and minor keys) harmony as we know today. In france, the earliest form of dance of what we know now as classical some of the step was developing. Todays ballet dancers still use still use some of the step names coined in the Baroque period. The melodies were like long, flowing, lines using lots of ornamentation (decoration). Ornamentation is the use of mordents, trills, turns-basically anything that is used to decorate the sound of the melody line, very common in Baroque music.</p>
